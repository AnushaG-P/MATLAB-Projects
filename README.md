# Computer Vision Projects and Certification

This repository serves as a consolidated space for a collection of projects related to Computer Vision, encompassing both academic endeavors and personal interest-driven certification courses.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a diverse range of projects, including those completed as part of academic coursework in Computer Vision and others pursued independently for personal development and certification.

## Project Categories

1. **Academic Projects**: This section includes projects completed as part of formal Computer Vision academic coursework. These projects are designed to demonstrate theoretical knowledge and practical application within the field.

2. **Certification Courses**: Here, you will find projects undertaken voluntarily, driven by a personal interest in Computer Vision. These projects reflect an additional commitment to mastering the subject beyond academic requirements.

## Folder Structure

To maintain organization and clarity, this repository is structured to clearly separate academic projects from personal interest-driven certification course projects. Each project is contained within its own directory, providing comprehensive documentation and code related to its specific scope.

Feel free to explore and use these projects as reference material for your own learning and development in the field of Computer Vision.

## License

All projects in this repository are open-source and available for educational and reference purposes. Please refer to the individual project directories for specific licensing details.
