# MATLAB Certification : 

The MATLAB project focuses on image segmentation & processing.

There are images such as - Concrete Crack Images, George VI Ice Shelf for ice cap melting, Great Flood of the Mississippi for checking the increase in area covered with water & other MathWorks Images.

The project also helps examine the differences between file types - PNG vs JPG. Images are stored as arrays of numbers and often include information known as meta-data. Accessing the Meta-data includes, timestamp from the meta-data enables you to identify the event's time or track events over time, View the meta-data, access individual pieces of meta-data, Viewing Non-UINT8 Images,

Analyzing Satellite Images of a Flood of the Mississippi River, one taken before a flood and one taken after. You can determine the increase in area covered with water using the image processing techniques you've learned so far.

Converting Between Color Spaces which includes converting an image from RGB to alternative color spaces and back to RGB.

Practice Thresholding Grayscale Images using Otsu's method for grayscale binarization with Effectiveness metric and also Setting a manual threshold.

Enhancing Images for Haze Reduction & Brightening Dark Images

Practice Adjusting Image Contrast using Image Histograms.
